End goal is to write our own API
Token - allows you to be authenticated
node.js - allows you to run java outside of a web

app.get  it's get request, so asking for something not sending
post - uploading data (node.js needs more data to firgure out)
body-parser (middleware) - stops request and examines it



app.use(bodyParser.json{}) ;         This looks for incoming data



app.post('/login', (req, res) =>{                                       //Allows us to send data        /login tells you what page it is
    const loginUser = req.body.userName;                                //
    CSSConditionRule.log('Login username:' +loginUser);                 //what we are requesting - it is logged
    res.send('Hello'+loginUser);                                        //
});
